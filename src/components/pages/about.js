  Hi there, I'm Mariusz Wiacek and I'm a front-end developer with a passion for building engaging and user-friendly websites. <br/><br/>

As a developer, I love the challenge of creating designs that not only look great but also provide a seamless and intuitive user experience. 
<br/><br/>
I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies.
<br/><br/>
In my free time, I love to explore the great outdoors. Travelling and hiking are my favorite activities, and I'm always up for a challenge. Whether it's a day hike or a multi-day backpacking trip, I love the sense of accomplishment that comes from pushing myself to new limits.
<br/><br/>
Overall, I'm passionate about using my skills as a front-end developer to create websites that make a difference in people's lives. Let's work together to build something great!
